# AI_ChatBot_With_Tensorflow
I made it after follow the tutorial from tech with tim, and edit some place to become my version.   
Basically, the training way of this project is to check whether their exist patterns in my json file to find which tag is about, and reply it.    

You can chat with me after run the code.
